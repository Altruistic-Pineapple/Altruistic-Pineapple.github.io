    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I believe user research, synthesis, and empathy are the path to create intuitive, and unobtrusive designs. Previous to UX, I worked as a photographer where I told the stories of established brands and individuals for over 5 years. My clients included Waze, Jose Cuervo, and Baxter of California. With UX design I now tell the stories of the user. I create personas that help businesses better understand their pain points so they can attain their goals. I use those goals as the foundation to build the blueprint for applications and websites.</p>
